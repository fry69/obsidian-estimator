# Obsidian Release Queue Estimator

Web-based dashboard for tracking and estimating review times for Obsidian community plugin and theme
submissions.

## Live Demo

Access the live dashboard at: https://obsidian-estimator.fry69.workers.dev/

## Features

- Displays current queue sizes for plugins and themes.
- Estimates review wait times based on historical data.
- Visualizes historical PR merge rates.
- Lists pending "Ready for review" pull requests.
- Lists recently merged pull requests with merge times.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, TanStack Query
- **Backend/Data Ingestion:** Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare KV, Cloudflare Cron Triggers

## Development

This project utilizes Cloudflare Workers for both frontend serving and scheduled data ingestion from
the GitHub API. Data is persisted in Cloudflare KV as a single JSON payload for fast reads.

## Setup

1.  **Clone repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3.  **Cloudflare KV:**
    - Create a KV namespace for queue data (one-time):
      `wrangler kv namespace create obsidian-queue-data`
    - Create a KV namespace for storing GitHub OAuth tokens (one-time):
      `wrangler kv namespace create obsidian-github-oauth`
    - Update `wrangler.jsonc` with the namespace IDs returned by Wrangler (if not done automatically).
4.  **GitHub App OAuth (avoid using Personal Access Tokens):**
    - Create a new GitHub App in the [developer settings](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) of your GitHub account or organization.
    - Cheat Sheet for creating a GitHub App:
      - Name: **[Any Name]**
      - Description: [Any Description]
      - Homepage: **[GitHub URL]**
      - Callback URL: **[GitHub URL]** *(placeholder; unused)*
      - **Expire user authorization tokens:** **ON**
      - **Request user authorization during installation:** **OFF**
      - **Enable Device Flow:** **ON**
      - Setup URL: *(blank)*
      - Redirect on update: **OFF**
      - Webhook: **OFF** *(no URL/secret)*
      - Permissions: **none** (repo/org/account all unset)
      - Events: **none**
      - Installation: **Any account**
    - **Generate a Client Secret** for the App and note down the Client ID and Client Secret.
5. **Setup credentials and OAuth token:**
    - Add the GitHub App credentials as Cloudflare secrets (repeat per environment as required):
      - `wrangler secret put GH_CLIENT_ID`
      - `wrangler secret put GH_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - Complete the Appâ€™s OAuth flow once (with the account that should back the ingest worker) and
      capture the returned `refresh_token`. Store it in the `GITHUB_OAUTH` KV namespace under the
      `GH_REFRESH` key:
      - `wrangler kv key put --binding GITHUB_OAUTH GH_REFRESH <refresh_token>`
    - Use the helper script in `vendor/tools/device-flow.sh` to walk through the GitHub device
      authorization flow and obtain the `refresh_token`. Export your GitHub App credentials, run the
      script, then follow the prompts:

      ```bash
      GH_CLIENT_ID="<your_app_client_id>" \
      GH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your_app_client_secret>" \
      ./vendor/tools/device-flow.sh
      ```

      The script prints a `verification_uri` and `user_code`. Open the URL in your browser, paste or
      type the one-time code, and approve the request. Leave the script running; once GitHub
      completes the authorization it will display the `refresh_token` you need to store in KV.
6.  **Deploy:**
    - Production: `npm run deploy`

## Data Ingestion

Data is automatically updated via Cloudflare Cron Triggers, fetching information from the
`obsidianmd/obsidian-releases` GitHub repository. Each run computes two KV entries:

- a lightweight summary containing wait-time estimates, queue counts, and weekly merge statistics
  (`/api/summary`)
- the full PR details blob used by the tables (`/api/details`), which is only rewritten when the
  upstream data actually changes

The frontend polls the summary key and only requests the detailed payload when a new version is
available, keeping the initial load fast even when the queue is large.

### Manual refresh endpoint

You can force a refresh outside the cron schedule by calling the authenticated `/api/trigger`
endpoint. Supply the same bearer token you configured in the `TRIGGER_TOKEN` secret:

```bash
wrangler secret put TRIGGER_TOKEN
```

```bash
curl -X POST "<your-worker-url>.workers.dev/api/trigger" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRIGGER_TOKEN"
```

When developing locally, replace the hostname with the URL printed by `npm run dev` (often
`http://127.0.0.1:5173`). A successful request returns HTTP 202 while the ingest job runs in the
background. The ingestion process can take up to a minuete or longer depending on queue size.
